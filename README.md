## Installation
For development on this project you will need to complete the following.

### Frontend
blah blah blah?? @c-young02

### Flask and PostgresQL
Move into the flask-app folder

``cd flask-app``

Install the python project requirements

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Initialise an instance of postgresQL - I used JetBrains DataGrid as it is easy to use. Based on how 
you decide to do this change config.py to allow the connection to be established.

To run the flask development server

``cd ..``

``python run.py``

## Features
Probs don't even want this section, probs like a PEP8 linting badge or something can
go here to show how cool we are.
